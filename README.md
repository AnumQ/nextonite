This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.


## Notes

pages - Associated with a route based on their file name. For example, pages/about.js is mapped to /about

public - Stores static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public directory can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).

A page is a React Component exported from a .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file in the pages directory. You can even add [https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes] (dynamic route) parameters with the filename.

Next.js is built around the concept of pages. A page is a React Component exported from a .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file in the pages directory. You can even add dynamic route parameters with the filename.
